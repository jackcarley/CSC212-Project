-----------------------------------Hilbert Curve-----------------------------------
by Jack Carley

To compile the Hilbert Curve file run a g++ compiler command simimlar to the following in your computer's terminal 
$g++ hilbert_curve.cpp -o main
where "hilbert_curve.cpp" is the name of the file and "main" is the desired name for the executable file
To then run the file, run the following command in your computer's terminal
./main 5 output.txt
where "5" is the desired order count for the Hilbert Curve and output.txt is the file name
Make sure that the file name ends in a .txt as the output is only combatible with .txt files

If you want to convert the .txt file to an image file, there is a python script provided in the Hilbert Curve directory
The python script any2img.py was provided by the CSC212 class and was not created by any of the group members

To run the python script, run the following in your computer's terminal
python3 any2img.py <in_file> <out_file>
