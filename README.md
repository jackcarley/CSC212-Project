--------------------------------------Hilbert Curve--------------------------------------
by Jack Carley

To compile the Hilbert Curve file run a g++ compiler command simimlar to the following in your computer's terminal 
$g++ hilbert_curve.cpp -o main
where "hilbert_curve.cpp" is the name of the file and "main" is the desired name for the executable file
To then run the file, run the following command in your computer's terminal
./main 5 output.txt
where "5" is the desired order count for the Hilbert Curve and output.txt is the file name
Make sure that the file name ends in a .txt as the output is only combatible with .txt files

If you want to convert the .txt file to an image file, there is a python script provided in the Hilbert Curve directory
The python script any2img.py was provided by the CSC212 class and was not created by any of the group members

To run the python script, run the following in your computer's terminal
python3 any2img.py <in_file> <out_file>

-----------------------------------Sierpinski Triangle-----------------------------------
by Hassan Bhatti

In order to compile the Sierpinski Triangle file, please run the g++ compiler in the terminal. Based on the version of your IDE,
you may or may not need and extension of -s=c++11. You amy also use -o main for the execution or ./a.out command in the 
terminal only if after you have previously compiled the code.

Once the code has been compile and executed, there will be a user based command prompt.
